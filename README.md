# TensorFlow-study

This is where I study TensorFlow with various resources.

HML folder is where I store all my practice codes by follwing **Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** book. 

TF_T folder is where I store all my codes by following the **Official TensorFlow Tutorials**.

ZTM folder is where I store all my codes by follwing the **[ZTM TensorFlow Course by Daniel Bourke](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-tensorflow/)**.
