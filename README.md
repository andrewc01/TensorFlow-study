# TensorFlow-study

This is where I study TensorFlow with various resources.

TF_T folder is where I store all my codes by following the official TensorFlow Tutorials.

ZTM folder is where I store all my codes by follwing the ZTM TensorFlow Course by Daniel Bourke](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-tensorflow/).
